        <strong><em>Summary:</em></strong> From the "Seven Sages" of ancient
        times, we can learn fundamental life lessons, including the importance
        of moderation, self-knowledge, the continuous pursuit of knowledge,
        social responsibility, and the acceptance of uncertainty. These
        principles are timeless and help us lead balanced, reflective and
        fulfilling lives. <br
      /></span>
      Examples of teachings from the Seven Sages: <br /><br />
      <div class="boxes">
        <div class="box1" data-aos="flip-left">
          <strong><em>"Nothing in excess!"</em></strong> <br />
          (Attributed to Democritus, but often associated with the Seven Sages)
          – This maxim emphasizes the importance of moderation in all areas of
          life in order to find balance and well-being.
        </div>
        <div class="box2" data-aos="flip-left">
          <strong><em>"Know thyself!"</em> </strong><br />
          – This is a call for self-knowledge and reflection in order to
          understand one's own strengths, weaknesses, and motivations.
        </div>
        <div class="box3" data-aos="flip-left">
          <strong><em> "Everything is practice!"</em> </strong><br />
          This teaching emphasizes that mastery in skills or in life is only
          achieved through constant practice and striving for improvement.
        </div>
        <div class="box4" data-aos="flip-left">
          <strong> <em>Strive for knowledge and increase knowledge</em></strong>
          (Thales of Miletus)
          <br />
          This principle encourages us to remain curious, to seek knowledge and
          never to be satisfied with the current state of knowledge.
        </div>
      </div>
      <span data-aos="flip-up">
        These teachings are timeless, universal, and still relevant today. They
        offer a holistic approach to a successful and happy life that goes
        beyond mere intelligence. These principles can be directly integrated
        into everyday life to make better decisions and live a more fulfilling
        life. Click on the videos above if you want to learn more.</span
