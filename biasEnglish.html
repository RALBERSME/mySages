      <div class="intro">
        Bias of Priene was the son of Teutames from the Asia Minor city of
        Priene. He became famous for his eloquence and persuasiveness in legal
        disputes.
        <br /><br />
        He is said to have given the Ionians, when they had gathered in
        Panionium despite a defeat by the victorious Persians, the following
        advice: If their freedom was important to them, they should emigrate
        from Ionia to Sardinia and establish their own city there. This would
        not only enable them to escape slavery but also build prosperity.

        <div data-aos="flip-up">
          Bias of Priene probably lived in the 6th century BC, approximately
          between 550 and 490 BC, and worked primarily in the Asia Minor city of
          Priene, which lay on the Mysius River in what was then the Ionian
          coastal region.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-up">
          Few reliable details about Bias's specific education have been
          preserved; however, ancient sources report that Bias received a sound
          philosophical and political education. He was probably familiar with
          both legal and administrative tasks and was a respected figure in
          Priene, seeking and giving advice.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-up">
          Bias of Priene is often described as a prime example of a wise
          lawgiver. His work is characterized in ancient tradition primarily by
          the following features:<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-up">
          He is said to have aligned political power with principles of justice,
          consistency of law, and the protection of civil rights. He combined
          political decisions with ethical responsibility.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-up">
          Its guiding principles often emphasize the call to exercise
          moderation, avoid excessive luxury, and seek harmony in the
          community.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-up">
          Bias' policies were said to be aimed at ensuring stable governance of
          the community, ensuring public order, and promoting the economic
          well-being of its citizens.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-up">
          As one of the Seven Sages, he is credited with clear, concise, and
          persuasive oratory skills, which he used to influence advice and
          decisions.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-up">
          Bias is one of the Seven Sages because ancient chroniclers see him as
          a representative of a category of political teachers who excelled in
          practical wisdom in government. Bias embodied the combination of
          prudent politics, ethical orientation, and advisory authority.
          Furthermore, like the other sage figures, he came from an important
          Greek polis—Priene in Ionia.
          <br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-up">
          Bias' name is synonymous with a policy that emphasizes law and order
          without falling into tyranny or excess.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-up">
          The combination of moderation, the rule of law, and state welfare
          makes Bias an exemplary “state teacher” type of Greek antiquity.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-up">
          Priene, his hometown, was known for its systematic urban planning and
          republican aspirations, which further enhanced Bias's reputation as a
          wise man.<br /><br />
