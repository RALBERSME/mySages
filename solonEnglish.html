            Solon was an Athenian statesman and poet. He was a social analyst,
            politician, and reformer during a deep crisis in the Athenian polis.
            He also became known early on as a poet, philosopher, and orator.<br /><br />

          <div>
            He paved the way for Athens' transition from the Classical period to
            Athenian democracy. He was largely responsible for the prohibition
            and outlawing of debt slavery in Athens. He advocated for the shared
            responsibility and commitment of every individual citizen to the
            just order (eunomia) within the polis. He also established the
            permanent commitment of the entire citizenry to rule through laws.
            <br /><br />After completing his reforms, Solon began to travel,
            thus placing the implementation of the new order in the citizens'
            own responsibility.

          In detail: <br /><br />
          Solon of Athens is one of the most famous figures of ancient Greece.
          His life and work had a lasting impact on Athenian politics and laid
          the foundation for many ideas about legislation, justice, and
          government.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-right">
          • Solon probably lived in the 6th century BC, often dated between c.
          638 and 558 BC. He came from a noble Athenian family, but did not
          belong to the strict aristocratic elite. His time was marked by social
          tensions between rich and poor, as well as between poverty, debt, and
          political unrest.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="flip-left">
          • Little is known for certain about Solon's specific education. In
          ancient accounts, he is described as an enlightened statesman who is
          said to have enjoyed a broad education in jurisprudence, ethics,
          politics, and rhetoric. He is seen as someone who brought both
          theoretical insight and practical experience in the administration of
          the community.
          <br /><br />
          <div data-aos="flip-right">
            • His most famous achievement was the reform policy in Athens, which
            aimed to reduce social divisions and create the foundations of a
            stable political order.<br /><br />
          </div>
          <div data-aos="flip-left">
            • He introduced measures to counteract the debt burden on citizens,
            introduced a uniform debt freeze, and regulated real estate trading.
            In doing so, he attempted to provide relief to the poorer population
            and alleviate social tensions.<br /><br />
          </div>
          <div data-aos="flip-right">
            • He also introduced the principle of popular participation to
            counteract an overly powerful aristocracy. He created new legal
            institutions and amended the constitution so that more citizens
            could participate in the political decision-making process. In doing
            so, he laid the foundation for an increasingly democratic movement
            in Athens, even if democracy was not yet complete.<br /><br />
          </div>
          <div data-aos="flip-left">
            • Solon emphasized the rule of law, clear laws, and the importance
            of ethics in politics. The balance between freedom, order, and
            justice was at the heart of his teachings.<br /><br />
          </div>
          <div data-aos="flip-right">
            • He sought to promote fairness in economic exchange, strengthen
            trust in the legal system, and create stability in the community.<br /><br />
          </div>
          <div data-aos="flip-left">
            • He is credited with a clear, coherent, and convincing style of
            speaking with which he gave advice and influenced political
            decisions.<br /><br />
          </div>
          <div data-aos="flip-right">
            • Solon is seen in ancient tradition as a representative of wise,
            practical government and is therefore classified as one of the Seven
            Sages because he combined a comprehensive political vision with
            concrete reforms aimed at justice, moderation, and the welfare of
            the community. Furthermore, he came from Athens, one of the central
            cities of the Greek world, and left a lasting mark on the history of
            statesmanship. The combination of the rule of law, political
            participation, social balance, and rhetorical clarity made him a
            classic figure of the Seven Sages – even if the historical details
            are fragmentary and legends blend with the facts.
            <br /><br />
          </div>
          <div data-aos="flip-left">
            • Solon's reforms were not seen as a final solution, but as a first
            step toward a more modern, just order.<br /><br />
          </div>
          <div data-aos="flip-right">
            • His principle of “wisdom through practice” is reflected in his
            popular measures: clear laws, fair structures, and policies designed
            to strengthen the community.<br /><br />
          </div>
          <div data-aos="flip-left">
            • Solon's work shows how political wisdom can create long-term
            stability in a time of great tension and how the first democratic
            ideas develop in a highly hierarchical society.
