        Pittacus of Mytilene was appointed as arbitrator (aisymnetes) in
        Mytilene on Lesbos in the struggle between the aristocracy and the
        people on the one hand, and various aristocratic factions (stasis) on
        the other.

          Pittacus's name is closely associated with the Ionian city of Mytilene
          on Lesbos, a region that in ancient times stood for trade, culture,
          and learning.<br /><br />
          The exact dates of Pittacus' birth and death are unknown, and there
          are various traditions regarding his life dates.<br /><br />
          According to the popular timeframe, Pittacus lived in the 7th or early
          6th century BC, roughly contemporary with the other famous sages of
          the period, including Solon, Bias, Chilon, and others.<br /><br />
          The few surviving evidences suggest that he played a leading role in
          political and social life in Mytilene and was respected for his wisdom
          and power of speech.<br /><br />
          He came from Mytilene, an important polis on the island of Lesbos,
          characterized by trade, seafaring, and cultural interconnectedness.
          From the fragmentary evidence, it emerges that Pittacus worked in an
          intellectual environment where education, rhetoric, ethics, and
          statecraft were valued.

        <div class="card" data-aos="flip-left">
          Pittakos is said to have learned how to give legislative advice,
          maintain moderation, avoid divisions in society, and how to make wise
          decisions in difficult political crises. The sources suggest that his
          education was strongly influenced by oral tradition, the practice of
          giving advice, and experience in public life.<br /><br />
          What particularly distinguishes Pittakos among wise figures is his
          ability to combine practical wisdom with ethical guidance. Mythical
          and literary sources reveal several characteristics and teachings
          attributed to Pittakos:<br /><br />
          • Moderation and lifestyle: Pittakos is said to have emphasized that
          moderation and restraint are virtues in all areas of life—in politics,
          business, and personal relationships. Excessive desire, wealth, or
          power could endanger political stability.<br /><br />
          • At a time when the Greek poleis were developing their principles of
          coexistence, Pittacus emphasized the importance of firm, just
          governance of state and society. His advice was intended to help
          defuse conflicts and protect the community.
        </div>
        <div class="card" data-aos="flip-left">
          • He likely emphasized that political decisions must not only be
          effective, but also morally justifiable. Rulers without ethical
          foundations cannot create long-term security.<br /><br />
          • As a wisdom teacher, Pittakos understood the art of persuasion.
          Through clear, concise words, he was meant to reach the audience and
          give people guidance.<br /><br />
          • Narrative tradition often cites Pittakos as an example of how a wise
          ruler also protects the people's wealth. Great desires should be
          controlled so that no one endangers the common good.
          <br /><br />
          Pittakos is counted among the Seven Sages for the following reasons:
          He produced practical, skillful advice for rule and played a central
          role as a wise legislator, orator, and advisor. Pittakos is associated
          with characteristics such as moderation, constitutional wisdom,
          harmony of politics and morals, and skillful rhetoric. He also comes
          from Mytilene (Lesbos), a cultural and commercial city of antiquity,
          which positions him in the traditional accounts as one of the leading
          wise figures of that period.
