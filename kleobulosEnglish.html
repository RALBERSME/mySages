            Cleobulus of Lindos was the tyrant of Lindos, an important port city
            on the Greek island of Rhodes, in the 6th century BC. Unlike later
            tyrants, however, he was not considered a dictator, but rather a
            politician who was viewed positively by later generations.

      Specific details about Cleobulus's education are scarce. He likely
      received an education that encompassed jurisprudence, ethics, politics,
      rhetoric, and morality – the ideals of a political teacher of
      antiquity.<br /><br />
      Typical of Cleobulus is the idea that he brought with him both theoretical
      insight and administrative experience, which made him a suitable advisor
      and legislator.
      <br /><br />
      Cleobulus is one of the figures who embodies a clear orientation towards
      the rule of law, order, and the common good. His teachings probably
      emphasized justice, moderation, and the protection of civil rights within
      a stable order.<br /><br />
      Like other sage figures, Cleobulus is associated with the virtue of
      moderation. He is said to have balanced the desire for power or luxury in
      favor of a harmonious community.<br /><br />
      As a wise state advisor, Cleobulus is said to have worked to stabilize the
      community, promote public order, and support the economic well-being of
      the citizens. His policies reflected the ideal that politics was a service
      to the community, not an end in itself.<br /><br />
      Cleobulus embodied the combination of theoretical knowledge and practical
      government. His idea was that wisdom comes not only from writings, but
      from concrete political decisions and administrative experience.<br /><br />
      Cleobulus of Lindos is considered one of the Seven Sages because he is
      seen in ancient traditions as a representative of practical wisdom and
      governmental leadership. Like the other sages, Cleobulus is characterized
      by a mixture of theoretical understanding and concrete administrative
      experience. His thinking emphasized justice, order, and the protection of
      the citizenry as the foundation of good governance. He saw politics as a
      service to the community, not as an end in itself, and focused on
      stability, harmony, and the welfare of citizens. He is credited with
      speaking clearly and convincingly to provide guidance and legitimize
      decisions.
