          Thales is often called the first Greek philosopher because he is said
          to have attempted to explain the world through natural principles
          rather than interpreting it primarily through myth. His supposed
          contributions include:<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-left">
          • Natural philosophy and explanation of nature: Thales searched for
          the primal principle of the world. He is said to have considered water
          the arche that underlies all things, an interpretation that is
          understood today as a symbolic statement about an underlying,
          all-encompassing principle. Whether he actually considered water to be
          the source of all things or whether this is a highly interpretive
          attribution is disputed; what is certain, however, is that he claimed
          to be seeking natural causes.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-right">
          • Geometry and Mathematics: Thales is associated with early geometric
          theorems, including the famous theorem that a circle is uniquely
          determined by three points and that a circumcircle of a triangle
          divides its diameter from its center. The Thales Selo (theorem)—that
          an angle in a semicircle is a right angle—is often attributed to or
          associated with him, although historical evidence for it is
          fragmentary. Nevertheless, he is considered a pioneer of geometry,
          using mathematics as a tool for knowledge.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-left">
          • Astronomy and calendars: He is credited with observations that
          distinguish him: systematizing cosmic phenomena, such as those that
          serve as a precursor to scientific astronomy. History tells us that he
          had similar ideas about moonlight and the position of the sun, making
          him an early observer of the sky.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-right">
          • Technology and Finance: Thales is said to have used a clever method
          of capacity and observation to determine the value of oil – the legend
          of Thales, who predicted oil prices and thus demonstrated an economic
          form of forecasting by relying on predictions and observations.
          Whether this story actually happened historically remains unclear, but
          it stands as a symbolic story that knowledge can also be used in
          practical matters. Why he is counted among the Seven Sages The Seven
          Sages – the Seven Wise Men of Greece – are a group of lawmakers,
          poets, and wise strategists who supposedly lived in the 7th to 6th
          centuries BC. The list of the Seven Sages varies depending on the
          source; in popular tradition, Thales, Solon, Bias, Pittacus,
          Cleobulus, Periander, and Chilon are often mentioned.
          <br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-left">
          • Teaching and influence: Thales is said to have had many students and
          thus spread the idea of ​​understanding the world through rational
          observation. His approach laid the foundation for later Greek natural
          philosophy.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-right">
          • Myth vs. Science: The legends surrounding Thales demonstrate the
          transition from mythological explanations to scientific explanations –
          a sign of the change in ancient scientific culture. • Art and
          Architecture: Through geometric thinking, Thales also influenced
          applications in architecture and urban planning, where precise
          measurements were important.<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-left">
          • Legacy: Thales serves as a symbol of the fact that curiosity, powers
          of observation, and logical thinking are the foundations of all
          science.
          <br /><br />
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-right">
          • Because of his role as one of the first to seek a rational
          explanation for natural phenomena, and because of his contributions to
          geometry and mathematical thought, Thales is considered one of the
          Seven Sages.
