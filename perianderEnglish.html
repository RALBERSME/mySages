        Initially, Periander was said to have been a peaceful ruler.<br />But
        then, as Parthenius of Nicaea reported, an incident occurred that
        completely transformed his character. Periander's mother, Cratea, is
        said to have fallen in love with him and sneaked up to him in the dark
        of night, seduced him, and disappeared again before sunrise. Thus,
        Periander's identity remained hidden for a time. But after a while, when
        his mother lay down with him again, he lit a lamp and discovered that
        his mother was his lover. He was so enraged that he initially wanted to
        kill her. Even though he let her live, he began to massively transform
        into a violent and cruel ruler.

        Periander was considered the prototype of the tyrant, tough but
        far-sighted. Under his rule, Corinth developed into an economic and
        cultural flourishing. He allegedly planned the Corinth Canal, created a
        powerful fleet, and, through extensive trade and military successes
        (conquest of Epidaurus, Corcyra), ensured Corinth's greatest prestige in
        antiquity. His legislative successes included the allocation of land to
        poor peasants, employment creation measures, luxury laws, and the
        prohibition of slavery. In the dispute between Mytilene and Athens over
        Sigeion, Periander was appointed as a judge. He decided the dispute in
        favor of Athens. Periander of Corinth – the governor with the
        paradoxical record. In detail: <br /><br />
        Periander is usually dated to the 7th century BC, sometimes more
        precisely to the period around 625–585 BC. He was one of the earliest
        and longest-serving rulers of the Corinthian tyranny and acted during a
        period in which Greece was moving from lawless developments to more
        centralized forms of power.

        <br /><br />
        Periander came from Corinth, one of the richest and strategically most
        important cities in Greece, located directly on the Isthmus of Corinth.
        The ancient sources suggest that he was part of a dynastic rule that
        consolidated Corinth politically and, at the same time, was subject to
        the expectations of prudent, often strict governance. Concrete
        information on a formal "education" in the modern sense is lacking;
        rather, it can be said that Periander matured as a ruler during a time
        of great political practice: He learned political art, diplomacy, the
        balance of power, and the art of using resources to create stability.
        His upbringing may have been strongly influenced by the royal or
        tyrannical tradition of his city, in which leadership through fear,
        order, and economic rigor were considered virtues.
        <br /><br />
        He ruled Corinth during an era often referred to as the beginning of
        tyrannical rule in Greece. His reign is characterized by a mixture of
        economic prosperity, strong centralization, and strict legislation.
        Under his leadership, Corinth experienced a golden age of trade and
        infrastructure. Reports speak of a tight administration aimed at making
        Corinth the economic center of the Peloponnese. At the same time, his
        name is also associated in the sources with cruel or ruthless measures
        intended to ensure stability and order—an ambivalent record that makes
        Periander one of the most controversial figures in Greek governance.
        <br /><br />
        Periander is known more as a pragmatic statesman whose teachings result
        from the experience of political practice. Greek tradition often
        emphasizes the tension between efficiency, power, and humanity, which
        Periander may reflect: how much severity is necessary to maintain order,
        and at what price freedom and loyalty are bought. His reputation as a
        "tactical" ruler shows how political wisdom can also lie in the
        implementation of measures – not just in philosophical reflection, but
        in concrete action intended to ensure the functioning of a city.
        <br /><br />
        Periander is counted among the Seven Sages because he is accorded a
        place in ancient collections as one of the formative figures of early
        Greek state leadership. This classification is based less on written
        works than on the transmission of teachings, ways of life, and the role
        he played in the political culture of his time. In the collections and
        chronicles, he is often seen as a representative of a determined,
        order-oriented statecraft, which brings both positive impulses for
        growth and potential dangers through authoritarian tendencies. Thus,
        Periander is seen as a kind of bridge between economic strength,
        political power, and moral reflection – a figure whose work was
        considered instructive in the memory of the Greeks.
        <br /><br />
        Conclusion: <br /><br />
        Periander of Corinth remains a complex figure: a ruler who made Corinth
        economically strong and at the same time enforced a rigorous, sometimes
        fearsome political order. His classification among the Seven Sages is
        based on the traditional interpretations of ancient authors, who saw in
        him an exemplary combination of statecraft and moral responsibility. The
        legend of Periander continues to inspire reflection on the right measure
        of power, the costs of political action, and the balance between
        stability and freedom.
        <br /><br />Note: There are also lists of the Seven Sages in which
        instead of Periander, the following sage is named: Mysion (Myson of
        Chenai, also as Myson of Chen or mention forms). Mysion (Myson of
        Chenai; also Myson of Chen) was, according to ancient sources, a Greek
        philosopher; he is often considered a contemporary of Solon and other
        early statesmen, but concrete biographical data are lacking. Mysion
        appeared as one of the names in some of these lists, presumably due to
        his supposedly wise counsel, his political or social influence, or
        simply due to literary tradition that connects him with wise sayings or
        principles.
